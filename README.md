#### useState vs useReducer
useReducer can use when a complex state we use. useReducer is more powerful state management  
useState is using in main state and useful in symple update  
useReducer is using in related pieces of state/data or complex state updates

#### context API
using context API when managing global state
It is not suitable for use if it changes frequently. -> Redux is better way
not use context API in everything
